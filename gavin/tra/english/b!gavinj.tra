@0    = ~When I joined you, I swore I would help you as long as you served the greater good. I had hoped you would ammend your ways,  but you have not. This must end. I can no longer be party to such actions.~ [B!GAV_06]
@1    = ~When I joined you, I swore to serve you as long as you worked for the greater good. I have done my part, but your conduct has been less benevolent than I would like. We cannot go on like this! I cannot condone our actions.~ [BGAV_05]
@2    = ~You are leading us well, <CHARNAME>! The gods will smile on our actions. We are surely on the right path.~ [BGAV_02]
@3    = ~<CHARNAME>, I could not be happier about your leadership or about the work that we do. I am proud to call myself a servant of your cause!~ [BGAV_02]
@4    = ~Hello, Blane. How's the back today?~
@5    = ~You'd best be watchin' you don't track mud all over my floors, Gavin.~
@6    = ~What a pity! Let's hope they needed the gold they brought more than the temple.~
@7    = ~Heh. I s'pose. Fine floor, isn't it?~
@8    = ~It's beautiful, Bram.~
@9    = ~Mind you stay away from the gate, lad. Next time old Bram might not be around to let you back out.~
@10   = ~Yes, sir.~
@11   = ~Gods be good, Polus, haven't you dried out yet? Pay him no heed, <CHARNAME>. Just let him go sleep it off.~
@12   = ~Gavin, I know it has been a while since you were our neighbor, but you'll help an old friend, won't you?~
@13   = ~Of course, Mirianne. We'll keep our eyes open and send word if we hear anything.~
@14   = ~Thank you! I know Roe can take care of himself, but I would rest so much easier if I just knew that he is safe.~
@15   = ~And thank you, Gavin, for doing a favor for an old friend.~
@16   = ~I am glad to hear that Roe is in good health and will be on his way home soon. Give him my best when you see him.~
@17   = ~I will. Take care of yourself out there.~
@18   = ~Excuse me for troubling you, then, but is the lady of the house at home?~
@19   = ~No, she is not. I just do odd jobs. If you have business with her, you'll have to return another time. If you write, you might leave a note.~
@20   = ~No, thank you, that will not be necessary... Thank you for your time.~
@21   = ~Well, she must be doing well for herself, if she can have someone come in and do the cleaning.~
@22   = ~Excuse me, <CHARNAME>. I know the... family that lives here now, but they do not appear to be home. If you do not mind, we should go.~
@23   = ~You again?~
@24   = ~Er, yes. You haven't seen them recently, have you?~
@25   = ~Who do you think you are, barging in here and bothering a man who's just trying to earn an honest living?~
@26   = ~The girl is my daughter. I wanted to see her.~
@27   = ~Says you. Or maybe you are the kid's father, if you're the one who's been sending her the money. Anyway, they aren't at home.~
@28   = ~Listen, pal, you seem like a nice enough guy, so I'm going to give you a little advice. When a lady wants to see you, you'll know it. Take the hint, and leave them alone.~
@29   = ~*sigh* Very well.~
@30   = ~We might as well go, <CHARNAME>.~
@31   = ~Davis, it's me, Gavin.~
@32   = ~Oh. Hello, Gavin. Haven't seen you in years. Leave me alone, though. I'm in no mood for talkin'.~
@33   = ~All right, Davis. Sorry to hear things have been so hard for you and yours.~
@34   = ~You should know better, Gavin, bringin' that lot in here. Have you no respect? Get out, the lot of you.~
@35   = ~All right, Davis. I'm sorry. I had no idea things have been so hard for you and yours.~
@36   = ~Hello, Gavin. It's been years. You look well.~
@37   = ~Hello, yourself! Good to see you again, old friend. Is the family keeping well.~
@38   = ~They are, but Darla is visiting her mother with the children, so I have the place to myself for a while. Let us catch up on old times some other time, though. Was there anything you wanted?~
@39   = ~Can that be Gavin, hiding there in the back, with his head down? Don't worry, mate, I've stopped worrying about that bet years ago. So, <SIRMAAM>, where would you like to go?~
@40   = ~Gavin, is that you? I haven't seen your face in ages. I thought you'd died!~
@41   = ~Not yet, Otto, but it has been a while. How's the family?~
@42   = ~Ah, but they're mostly grown, now. The youngest will be wed next month, and then it's me an' the missus, all alone again, just like old times! But listen to me, talkin' when I should be pourin' ale. Can I get you anything, <SIRMAAM>?~
@43   = ~We'll just see about that!~
@44   = ~Gods, what a horrible adversary.~
@45   = ~Did we weather it all right?~
@46   = ~We'll manage.~
@47   = ~I could use some healing.~
@48   = ~<PLAYER2> could use some healing.~

@50   = ~<PLAYER4> could use some healing.~
@51   = ~<PLAYER5> could use some healing.~
@52   = ~<PLAYER6> could use some healing.~
@53   = ~If you say so...~
@54   = ~Certainly. Let me just see if I have the spell ready...~
@55   = ~Ah, but you are being too forward, to accost weary travelers. Leave us be, man.~
@56   = ~I would oblige, but I am awaiting the friend of a friend. Are you from Candlekeep?~
@57   = ~You've no business asking after names. Leave us be, man.~
@58   = ~I would oblige, but I am awaiting the friend of a friend. Are you <CHARNAME>?~
@59   = ~Now you've asked for it! Time to meet your god!~
@60   = ~This assassin knew much of your business, <CHARNAME>. You've a well-informed enemy.~
@61   = ~Is anyone hurt?~
@62   = ~We're fine. Let's just get inside.~
@63   = ~If you're sure...~
@64   = ~You shouldn't be out here on your own, child.~
@65   = ~You're naught but a bully, lad, and if you've been preying on honest merchants, you deserve the beating I hope you're about to get!~
@66   = ~You say that now, but if you don't hand over your money right quick, you'll see there's power behind that promise!~
@67   = ~<CHARNAME>, you must have heard of Drizzt! How could we not aid him?~
@68   = ~Sounds like a good idea, <CHARNAME>.~
@69   = ~*raises a pale eyebrow* Yes, as I was saying, I must be on my way. Fair journeys to you.~
@70   = ~Child, are you lost, as well?~
@71   = ~I just want my Rufie!~
@72   = ~How can we refuse such a request?~
@73   = ~Just hear me out! It's all I ask!~
@74   = ~<CHARNAME>, you must help them!~
@75   = ~That was close. Good thing you're honest, <CHARNAME>.~
@76   = ~<CHARNAME>, what a dishonest thing to do. We have no right to that gold.~
@77   = ~If you are intent on pursuing this bounty, let us hope that Prism can be persuaded to relinquish the emeralds without resorting to violence. His fate may be of little importance to Oublek, but I would not wish to see him harmed.~
@78   = ~This might have been justice, <CHARNAME>, but it was still wrong. My heart tells me there must have been something else we could have done. But what is done is done. May Brage be shown more kindess in the next life than he was in this.~
@79   = ~I apologize for my companion's rudeness.~
@80   = ~Yes, <CHARNAME>, we must help the people of this town. Tainted ore is bad enough, but we owe it to the families of these miners to do something.~
@81   = ~<CHARNAME>, the lives of the miners and the welfare of this town is at stake. There are more important things than gold.~
@82   = ~For the love of the gods, <CHARNAME>, are you mad?! ~
@83   = ~We will watch for him, ma'am.~
@84   = ~Please accept my condolences, ma'am. I am deeply sorry for your loss.~
@85   = ~<CHARNAME>, you shock me. I could not believe you capable of such cruelty.~
@86   = ~It was the least we could do. May the peace of Lathander bring you comfort.~
@87   = ~Really? Not bad, as cities go, but I prefer the quiet of small towns, myself. What did you see while you were there?~
@88   = ~Buildings and people. People threw stuff at me there, too.~
@89   = ~Poor man.~
@90   = ~Maybe those coins won't be so easily won!~
@91   = ~<CHARNAME>, your foes grow bolder! She was waiting for us here. Waiting! How can we fight an enemy that knows your plans better than you?~
@92   = ~Nice greeting. Who is this guy, anyway?~
@93   = ~Yours is an interesting life, <CHARNAME>. Not many people can boast of being the target of such... confident assassins. Fortunately, his confidence seems to have been misplaced.~
@94   = ~Are you all right?~
@95   = ~Just shaken. I'll recover.~
@96   = ~I'm fine.~
@97   = ~I'm a little dented.~
@98   = ~No thanks to you! I thought you were supposed to protect me from these thugs!~
@99   = ~That is fortunate. This just means that your pursuers haven't given up, so we're going to have to be even more careful.~
@100  = ~Hmmm. You look like you could use a bit of attention, to me. Shall I have a look at your injuries?~
@101  = ~I'll manage on my own. Thanks, anyway.~
@102  = ~If you wouldn't mind.~
@103  = ~Yes, you look like you could use a bit of attention. Shall I have a look at your injuries?~
@104  = ~Like hells you are! Shall I have a look at your injuries?~
@105  = ~I'll say! Just hold still...~
@106  = ~*Ahem* Yes, that was a rather unfortunate lapse. Still, you live yet, so perhaps the gods did not intend you to die this day, with or without my aid.~
@107  = ~If you are certain. I'm at your command, should you change your mind.~
@108  = ~Certainly. Just a moment...~
@109  = ~You are our leader, and I am sworn to see to your physical well-being while I am under your command. I do not need my years of training as a healer to see that you are hurt. Will you let me tend you?~
@110  = ~No, damn it. Stop mothering me!~
@111  = ~Very well.~
@112  = ~<CHARNAME>, you must not let them do this!~
@113  = ~<CHARNAME>, this is wrong!~
@114  = ~Have a care, <CHARNAME>. Hospitality in these parts is a little too convenient for my ease.~
@115  = ~I hope you know what you're doing, <CHARNAME>, because if I understand what he's saying, he's asking us to commit kidnapping and blackmail.~
@116  = ~<CHARNAME>, you are actually going to to go through with this, aren't you? You are in command, but this is wrong.~
@117  = ~We don't know what she's done, <CHARNAME>, but I hate to think what they will do to her if we don't help.~
@118  = ~<CHARNAME>, we must hear him out.~
@119  = ~<CHARNAME>, I, too, thought you were a better person than this. You are our leader, but you disappoint me.~
@120  = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot advise you in this. I do not want this to become a conflict between two temples, but my heart goes out to Tremain. He should not have to lose his son. I will stand by your decision, however.~
@121  = ~This is hardly an easy question, but I think helping these people is the right thing to do. We should hurry, or the lad will be gone beyond all recall.~
@122  = ~Poor Ragefast. He had no chance. How easy it is to fall in love, to become obsessed with a creature of such bewitching beauty. Yet loveliness and perfection of form are meaningless if the woman they endow is not also possessed of a heart kindred to her would-be lover.~
@123  = ~<CHARNAME>, your kindness has freed them both, although it may be some time before Ragefast realizes it, if he ever does.~
@124  = ~I do not know if Ragefast needed to die for his folly, though in the end, he might well have preferred it to living without the object of his desire.~
@125  = ~<CHARNAME>, how is it that such a beautiful creature can bring out the ugliness in us? We deserve her scorn.~
@126  = ~<CHARNAME>, be careful! Any offer preceeded by a statement like that can hardly be good.~
@127  = ~<CHARNAME>, this man is suggesting we abduct a living creature. Well, someone else has abducted her first, but that is not the point. Agree if you must, but we might consider freeing her from both men, instead.~
@128  = ~*After the briefest moment of shocked silence, Gavin screams and flings himself toward the gnome.*~
@129  = ~Beast! Come here, and I'll strangle you with my own hands! I'll teach you not to hurt children!~
@130  = ~Easy, mate! You're no better, or you wouldn't be in here.~
@131  = ~*still shaking with rage* I will contain my anger for your sake, <CHARNAME>, but I swear by all I hold sacred, if ever I see that gnome again, I will tear him limb from limb.~
@132  = ~*still shaking with rage* Just say the word, <CHARNAME>, and I swear by all I hold sacred, I will tear him limb from limb! Priest or no, I cannot abide the murder of children!~
@133  = ~Get a grip on yourself, man. If you kill me, your hope of escape dies, too. So back off, or your precious <CHARNAME> and the rest of you can rot in here.~
@134  = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, as the father of a small child, I can bear this no longer. If we must play this game again, guess well! My restraint weakens!~
@135  = ~Oh, ho! A small child, he says? Let the mad cleric at me, or guess again. I alone can give you freedom, and only if I live.~
@136  = ~Never that! Gods, get me away from this beast! May a thousand demons haunt your steps from this hour until the end of your miserable life! May you be tormented by every affliction known to man or the gods! May your sleep bring you no rest and waking bring you no relief from your nightmares!~
@137  = ~Be thou at peace, Gavin. The beast hath departed. Let not thy righteous fury overwhelm thee.~
@138  = ~Yes, I can see you are very ill indeed. We will make haste.~
@139  = ~We should help him, <CHARNAME>. Who will protect him if we don't? Nor should such talent be destroyed over a bounty.~
@140  = ~A bad choice, <CHARNAME>. He stole, but he does not deserve to die for it.~
@141  = ~A sad fate, <CHARNAME>, but one we were powerless to avert. Using the potions of haste was unwise, but we can do no more for him. Alas, his work is truly a masterpiece. At least it will endure.~
@142  = ~<CHARNAME>, that was uncalled for. We could have helped him. I am disappointed in you.~
@143  = ~Why did it have to be spiders? Regardless, <CHARNAME>, we must help him.~
@144  = ~<CHARNAME>, you know my feelings about spiders, but I know we must go after this Chelak. I hope for the best, but fear the worst. And when spiders are involved, the worst is pretty bad.~
@145  = ~I am sorry it had to end this way. Please accept my condolences.~
@146  = ~Send those spiders to their deaths! There aren't any arachnophobes here... except for Gavin.~
@147  = ~How adorable. But I admit to a certain bias.~
@148  = ~Dear gods, not again. It was dreadful enough the first time.~
@149  = ~With any luck, Kylee won't need to rely on that dagger for much longer. But let's find him and give it to him anyway, shall we?~
@150  = ~I'm sure he'd like it back.~
@151  = ~Your treachery cost the lives of countless miners and you accuse us?!~
@152  = ~We must stop it! We cannot allow it to go around petrifying everyone!~
@153  = ~This could only be the madman Bassilus.~
@154  = ~I fear High Mornmaster Ormlyr was right. He is clearly insane. But maybe he can still be saved.~
@155  = ~He is indeed beyond hope. We have no choice but to destroy him.~
@156  = ~We have no choice! We must fight for our lives!~
@157  = ~May his god have mercy upon him, he is mad.~
@158  = ~Alas, he is beyond our aid.~
@159  = ~I suppose this could have ended no other way.~
@160  = ~I suppose it was worth a shot.~
@161  = ~How sad it must end this way.~
@162  = ~Sounds like a good idea. What do you say, <CHARNAME>?~
@163  = ~<CHARNAME>, how could you even suggest such a thing!~
@164  = ~Why is it that someone can do something as incredibly evil as wiping out an entire clan of dwarves or enslaving scores of miners, and then wonder why we want to talk to him? Talk to the hammer, fiend!~
@165  = ~Come, then, <CHARNAME>, we owe Duke Eltan our aid. Let us see what we can do for him.~
@166  = ~Do not let this unsettle you, <CHARNAME>. The future is uncertain, true, but we have a hand in our own destiny.~
@167  = ~<CHARNAME>, how greedy can you be? The woman has been stone for the gods know how long, and you would take all she has?~
@168  = ~A charitable deed.~
@169  = ~Poor kid. He didn't stand a chance.~
@170  = ~*gulp* And what a horrible way to go.~
@171  = ~My gods, <CHARNAME>,... this place... I feel faint!~
@172  = ~You can do this, Gavin. Just keep it together a little while, and you'll be all right.~
@173  = ~Suck it up, man!~
@174  = ~Oh, for gods' sakes, Gavin, not now!~
@175  = ~Thanks. I'll try not to let you down.~
@176  = ~Trying, <SIRMAAM>.~
@177  = ~Do you think I want to be like this?!~
@178  = ~Poor blighter. The halfling almost made it back to Beregost with the letter.~
@179  = ~Well, this is good news! Travelling in winter is unpleasant, but at least he is safe and well. We should tell Mirianne as soon as possible.~
@180  = ~Yes, this was the place. I lived here for five years, but it seems a lifetime ago.~
@181  = ~I do not recognize this man, but that is hardly surprising.~
@182  = ~<CHARNAME>, can we please leave immediately. This is the home of Greta, a former neighbor I have no wish to meet again. She's indisposed, it seems. We are incredibly lucky. Let's not push our luck by lingering.~
@183  = ~Greta, eh? An old flame?~
@184  = ~Why do you dislike her?~
@185  = ~Whatever.~
@186  = ~No, Gavin. Let's check for valuables. No reason not to, if you don't like her, anyway.~
@187  = ~Gods, no! Just an irritable, petty woman with an ear for gossip.~
@188  = ~She's just an irritable, petty woman with an ear for gossip, nothing more. But that does not mean that I wish to run into her.~
@189  = ~Then let's leave quickly, shall we?~
@190  = ~Just because I don't like her is no reason to rob her. I have no taste for burglary. Let's leave, shall we?~
@191  = ~Yeuck! Please, I beg you, <CHARNAME>, do not ask me to carry that thing! I cannot abide spiders.~
@192  = ~YIIEEE! <CHARNAME>, please, have mercy on me! Give it to anyone else!~
@193  = ~My word! I... do not think that was a normal child!~
@194  = ~Another grieving family! I fear this will never end until the bandits are destroyed.~
@195  = ~Damn! How I wished we could bring the poor man's widow happier news! As if she did not have cares enough.~
@196  = ~Oh, very funny. Although I should be thankful for the opportunity to experience life as a woman, I am having a difficult time reconciling my sense of identity with my new body. Next time we're in town, can we get this removed?~
@197  = ~A tremendous improvement, if you ask me. (Although, I note that no one has. No matter. They are clearly deficient in wisdom, or they would have me leading the party instead of that fool <CHARNAME>.)~
@198  = ~Where did Gavin go?~
@199  = ~Tee, hee! Ya look good as a girl, Gavin. Too bad about that nose, though.~
@200  = ~If you are done playing, children, we have work to do.~
@201  = ~I'm a man again! Thank the gods! Lathander bless you, <CHARNAME>, I was not put on Toril to be a woman. The obsession about my complexion was bad enough, but the bloating was impossible!~
@202  = ~So now what?~
@203  = ~Jump~
@204  = ~Go back down, I guess.~
@205  = ~Like hells! We go down the stairs like normal people, or as close as we can manage. I have no fear of death, but I don't want to go this soon!~
@206  = ~Only choice, I guess. I am looking forward to going home to Lathander, but I would rather it wasn't today.~
@207  = ~That letter... says your father is Bhaal, the god of murder.~
@208  = ~And...~
@209  = ~That's what it says, but I am having trouble believing it. You would have thought there would have been some hint before now!~
@210  = ~Do you fear me because of it?~
@211  = ~And just think of all the possibilities.~
@212  = ~*And*?! And this is a little more serious than inheriting your father's nose or your mother's aptitude for music!~
@213  = ~You have the blood of a god in your veins, and not a benevolent god at that.~
@214  = ~What are you trying to tell me?~
@215  = ~I didn't ask for this, you know!~
@216  = ~I'm trying to tell you that you're going to have to make a big decision here. It all depends on you. Are you going to give in to the taint?~
@217  = ~I don't see it as a taint. I see it as an opportunity. All the possibilities...~
@218  = ~No! I will fight it, and keep doing what I know is right!~
@219  = ~All the possibilities? If you take that attitude, the only possibility this is going to give you is to become a monster. Is that what you want?~
@220  = ~No. I will fight it.~
@221  = ~If that is what it takes to gain that kind of power, I welcome it!~
@222  = ~Then I will gladly help you.~
@223  = ~Then it is time for us to part company. I am sorry.~
@224  = ~Oh, I know you did not. Who would? But the question is, now that you know what you are, what are you going to do with the knowledge?~
@225  = ~I just don't know, Gavin.~
@226  = ~I am still thinking about all the possibilities.~
@227  = ~Whatever else, I am not going to become evil. I will do what I have to do to fight whatever taint I have inherited.~
@228  = ~I hope you decide soon. You are not going to have long to make up your mind.~
@229  = ~What do you think the last several months have been? I know you have no control over who your father was. But the question is, now that you know what you are, what are you going to do with the knowledge?~
@230  = ~No, but I fear what you might become. I know you have no control over who your father was. But the question is, now that you know what you are, what are you going to do with the knowledge?~
@231  = ~The price on your head must really be substantial, to merit such persistance. We're just going to have to work that much harder to keep you safe.~
@232  = ~Xan, I have to talk to you.~
@233  = ~(sigh) Yes, you've been giving me strange looks for the past few hours. Not without reason, I suspect?~
@234  = ~No doubt. Xan, about <CHARNAME>, how could you?~
@235  = ~How, Gavin? Or why?~
@236  = ~I do not want to believe you capable of this! You, of all people! You led her to believe that you cared for her! She trusted you! Why? Why have you done this?~
@237  = ~Gavin, do you know what true closeness is?~
@238  = ~I know what it should be. Two people have similar beliefs, like valuing duty or showing mercy, share the same goals. A day without the other is a day lost. I is *not* about abandoning those who trust in you, and who... love you.~
@239  = ~It is indeed. And then what?~
@240  = ~I do not understand you.~
@241  = ~No, you don't. Few non-elves do. Gavin, when two humans grow closer the way you describe, they are generally happy. They lie together, they share their secrets... sometimes they marry and rear children.~
@242  = ~What would you know of human love? It is not so cold.~
@243  = ~Gavin, when elves love, there is more. We are a part of the Spirit, and we communicate within it... we are dead without it. And it is all too hard not to be of one heart with the one I love.~
@244  = ~There is much more to love than this. What of the simple joy of beholding the one you love, and knowing that they are happy? Or the giddy delight if that happiness is at least partially because her world contains you? Or the comfort of knowing that another soul knows everything there is to know about you, and loves you anyway?~
@245  = ~Perhaps. I thought so, once. But the lack of the oneness within the Weave only brings more and more pain. And eventually, only the lesser of the two evils remains.~
@246  = ~There is also the quiet contentment of emotional and physical togetherness, and the certainty that the years bring you nothing but memories of the life and the love you have shared. You should not have given up so quickly.~
@247  = ~Togetherness? Have you heard nothing? There is no true togetherness outside of the Spirit. No sharing of emotions; memories, falling apart. There is only pain.~
@248  = ~And what of her pain, Xan? You rejected her for something she could not even control!~
@249  = ~And would her pain have been less years hence, when the emptiness became unbearable?~
@250  = ~Many other elves have decided differently. And who could say they were not happy?~
@251  = ~I do not know, Gavin. I only know about myself, and that I am too weak to take this.~
@252  = ~Still, I think that you should at least ask her for forgiveness. Do you even know what she must be feeling now?~
@253  = ~Much the same as I, I suspect. But I shall not say more. And, no, I do not think I will approach her - and certainly not any other, elf or no - again.~

@306  = ~Ah... sorry 'bout that. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I've never been much of a drinker. My brother Jolun was always the wild one.

@332  = ~Would it work?~
@333  = ~Gods, what am I saying?! You're far too good for that. You are so beautiful, I suffer such pangs when I'm near you, but you'd never... You're such a fine lady... It would be like desecrating a temple...~
@334  = ~Why not? It's true. Don't argue with me. I don't lie.~

@342  = ~I am not sure I like that side of you.~
@343  = ~Actually, I rather liked your... candor. Who knows? With another drink or two, you might have said something really enlightening.~
@344  = ~Frankly, I'm disappointed in you.~
@345  = ~I didn't say anything I didn't mean, but thank you for being so understanding. Unfortunately, the gods did not endow me with the ability to forget my incautious confessions. <CHARNAME>, I was not lying about my... opinion of you.~
@346  = ~But if you will allow it, I would prefer to let it drop. I have no wish to make a fool of myself sober as well.~
@347  = ~I do, but I wish I had not said it under those circumstances. Unfortunately, the gods did not endow me with the ability to forget my incautious confessions. <CHARNAME>, I was not lying about my... opinion of you.~
@348  = ~I am not sure I do, either. Unfortunately, the gods did not endow me with the ability to forget my incautious confessions. <CHARNAME>, I was not lying about my... opinion of you.~

@350  = ~Frankly, so am I. Unfortunately, the gods did not endow me with the ability to forget my incautious confessions. <CHARNAME>, I was not lying about my... opinion of you. I just wish I had not said it while I was drunk.~
@351  = ~I think I'm in love with you.~
@352  = ~Why is it that every time you have a few drinks in you, you start tryin to sweet talk me?~
@353  = ~And I think you've had too much to drink.~
@354  = ~Are you really?~
@355  = ~Why don't you prove it?~
@356  = ~The drink loosens my tongue.~
@357  = ~If your tongue is so loose, come here. I think I have a use for it.~
@358  = ~It isn't very amusing, you know.~
@359  = ~Do you mean it, though?~
@360  = ~So then how would you prove your love for me?~
@361  = ~Believe me when I tell you the last thing I want to hear is drunken love confessions from my cleric!~
@362  = ~I have, but the drink only loosens my tongue. I'd say it anyway, if I dared.~
@363  = ~I think so. The drink only loosens my tongue, but I'd say it anyway, if I dared.~
@364  = ~How would I do that?~
@365  = ~Tell me when you're sober.~
@366  = ~Kiss me.~
@367  = ~Sleep with me.~
@368  = ~How would you like to prove your love for me?~
@369  = ~Gavin, please believe me when I tell you the last thing I want to hear is drunken love confessions from my cleric!~
@370  = ~Because the drink only loosens my tongue. I'd say it anyway, if I dared.~
@371  = ~What would that be?~
@372  = ~Let's get ourselves a room, and you can show me what you can do with it.~
@373  = ~See that woman over there? Go tell her how beautiful she is. I can use a laugh.~
@374  = ~You can use that loosened tongue of yours to explain why I should listen to the drunken love confessions of my cleric!~
@375  = ~Isn't it? You were the one that insisted on buying drink after drink, looking for gossip. I would be just as happy to admire you in silence. Please, <CHARNAME>, if you have no patience for the things I might say while in my cups, don't force them upon me. I have no more desire to make a fool of myself than the next man.~
@376  = ~If you doubt me, I could prove it, but I would prefer not to while in my cups. I have no more desire to make a fool of myself than the next man.~
@377  = ~It wouldn't be by forcing myself upon you after drinking more than my share, that is certain. I'm looking forward to proving my love for you some day, but I don't want to do it while deep in my cups. I have no more desire to make a fool of myself than the next man.~
@378  = ~If that is the case, maybe you shouldn't insist on buying drink after drink, looking for gossip. I would be just as happy to admire you in silence. Please, <CHARNAME>, if you have no patience for the things I might say while in my cups, don't force them upon me. I have no more desire to make a fool of myself than the next man.~
@379  = ~With pleasure! I would be just as happy to admire you sober. Please, <CHARNAME>, if you have no patience for the things I might say while in my cups, don't force them upon me. I have no more desire to make a fool of myself than the next man.~
@380  = ~I would never force myself upon you after drinking more than my share, even if you asked me to. I'm looking forward to proving my love for you some day, but I don't want to do it while deep in my cups. I have no more desire to make a fool of myself than the next man.~
@381  = ~My word! How I wish I dared. Still, I would never force myself upon you after drinking more than my share, even if you asked me to. I'm looking forward to proving my love for you some day, but I don't want to do it while deep in my cups. I have no more desire to make a fool of myself than the next man.~
@382  = ~Why don't we talk about it some time when we're both sober. There are so many things I want to say, and I don't want to say any of them while deep in my cups. I have no more desire to make a fool of myself than the next man.~
@383  = ~You can be a cruel woman, <CHARNAME>.~
@384  = ~Forget it, Gavin. You didn't do anything you'd regret.~
@385  = ~You shouldn't drink so much.~
@386  = ~Did you mean it when you said you love me?~
@387  = ~I'm sorry, Gavin. I know you have no head for drink.~
@388  = ~Thank Lathander for that.~
@389  = ~It was your idea! Next time, let's visit a temple if we want some gossip.~
@390  = ~I don't think you'll have too long to wait to find out.~
@391  = ~Ah, that's all right. But let's just be careful we don't repeat that too many times. It really isn't good for us.~
@392  = ~*Gavin rises unsteadily to his feet and stands beside you. He embraces you very deliberately, in the sight of everyone in the common room.*~
@393  = ~*Gavin tilts your head to meet his and kisses you deeply. He loses himself in the kiss, and his hands start to wander over your body.*~
@394  = ~Hey, there! None of that!~
@395  = ~Why, Gavin, you are so forward! How far do you intend to take this?~
@396  = ~Do you intend to take me right here in the common room?~
@397  = ~That feels so good. Don't stop!~
@398  = ~What in the nine hells do you think you're doing?~
@399  = ~Ye gods! I'm sorry! Got carried away.~
@400  = ~Hmmm? Oh, my! We are in public, aren't we? Really, this was as far as I meant to go, really. Sorry about that.~
@401  = ~Wha-? Oh, my! Right in the middle of the common room, too! I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I really did get carried away.~
@402  = ~What? Oh my! Making a fool of myself in public, same as usual. Sorry, beloved. I got carried away.~
@403  = ~I guess I have proven once again that you can't trust me to behave myself in public.~
@404  = ~You stopped too soon!~
@405  = ~I wouldn't have minded if we slept together, you know.~
@406  = ~I'll say! What were you thinking?~
@407  = ~If we were alone, it wouldnt' have bothered me.~
@408  = ~Why is it that every time you drink, you try to take our relationship further than I am ready to go?~
@409  = ~No, my love, I stopped just in time. Everything else aside, if you were about to bestow the honor of your favor upon me, I would deeply prefer to be sober.~
@410  = ~Neither would I, my love, but not yet. Everything else aside, if you were about to bestow the honor of your favor upon me, I would deeply prefer to be sober.~
@411  = ~I wasn't. That was the problem. But it would have gone no further, in any case. Everything else aside, if you were about to bestow the honor of your favor upon me, I would deeply prefer to be sober.~
@412  = ~Maybe, maybe not, but it would bother me. Everything else aside, if you were about to bestow the honor of your favor upon me, I would deeply prefer to be sober.~
@413  = ~Because I love you, and I want you. But it would have gone no further, in any case. Everything else aside, if you were about to bestow the honor of your favor upon me, I would deeply prefer to be sober.~
@414  = ~*Gavin rises somewhat unsteadily and takes your hand. He leads you away from everyone else, to a very quiet corner.*~
@415  = ~*He kisses you deeply, passionately. Seeemingly forgetting everything but your proximity and his own desire, his hands wander over your body freely.*~
@416  = ~Let's knock boots.~
@417  = ~What did you just say?!~
@418  = ~What? Here?~
@419  = ~I don't see why not. Let's get a room first, though, all right?~
@420  = ~Are you serious?~
@421  = ~Right here, right now!~
@422  = ~Sorry. I might have phrased that a bit indelicately. Maybe I'd better ask you sometime when I'm sober.~
@423  = ~Well, we could get a room first. But soon, all right? I don't know how long I can wait.~
@424  = ~*Gavin's answer is somewhere between a growl and a groan, and he resumes kissing you with renewed enthusiasm.*~
@425  = ~Don't wait too long, love. I don't know how long I can hold out.~
@426  = ~Well, I meant that we should get a room first. But please, love, don't wait too long. I don't know how long I can hold out.~
@427  = ~Well, that was pathetic, that night, you know the one I mean.~
@428  = ~Oh, it wasn't so bad.~
@429  = ~Maybe you shouldn't drink so much next time.~
@430  = ~I enjoyed myself. You did, too. No regrets, here.~
@431  = ~You mean you weren't trying for a new speed record?~
@432  = ~Nothing happened, Gavin, remember?~
@433  = ~You're sweet, love, and I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself, but I want have all my wits about me when I come to your bed. The gift you give me is too precious to waste on a drunken man.~
@434  = ~Without a doubt! I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself, but I want have all my wits about me when I come to your bed. The gift you give me is too precious to waste on a drunken man.~
@435  = ~I don't know if I would go far enough to say I regretted it. I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy myself, but I want have all my wits about me when I come to your bed. The gift you give me is too precious to waste on a drunken man.~
@436  = ~I was overcome by my enthusiasm, but I'm sorry I was not as sensitive as I could have been. In the future, I want have all my wits about me when I come to your bed. The gift you give me is too precious to waste on a drunken man.~

@438  = ~Dynaheir, I admire you greatly.~
@439  = ~I am glad to have won thy good opinion, but I merely follow my conscience.~
@440  = ~And that is why I enjoy your company so much. Would you... would you step aside with me for a moment?~
@441  = ~Gavin, leave Dynaheir alone.~
@442  = ~*remain silent*~
@443  = ~Are you actually trying to seduce Dynaheir?~
@444  = ~This I have to see!~
@445  = ~As you wish. I guess we can talk here just as easily. Dynaheir... I wanted to ask you about the role of religion in Rasheman.~
@446  = ~Religion is part of life across Faerun, here or in Rasheman. I beg thy pardon, but this is no fit place to instruct thee in the customs of my land.~
@447  = ~Would you like to talk about it somewhere more private?~
@448  = ~Thou art too merry for serious discourse.~
@449  = ~Ah... well... oh, bother. I think I'll go talk to Minsc.~
@450  = ~Is Minsc more to your tastes, Gavin?~
@451  = ~(let it drop)~
@452  = ~Ah... well... oh, bother. It wasn't important anyway, I guess.~
@453  = ~Gavin, do I hear you asking glorious Dynaheir to do inappropriate things with you?~
@454  = ~No, Minsc! I asked her to step aside with me. I wanted to... talk about Rashemen religion with her.~
@455  = ~Ah... well... oh, bother. Anyway, Minsc, would you let me see that armband you bought? I didn't get a very good look at it when you showed it to me.~
@456  = ~Gavin, thy singular attention is most alarming.~
@457  = ~I apologize. I merely wanted to... talk about Rashemen religion with you.~
@458  = ~What? Ah... no! I wanted to... talk about Rashemen religion with her.~
@459  = ~I didn't know Minsc cared much for religion... oh! No, not like that! Gods, why did I let you buy me all that drink? I'd like to go sleep this off now, before I make even more of a fool of myself.~
@460  = ~Viconia, your grace is a delight to behold.~
@461  = ~Wag your worthless tongue in some surface slut's face, jaluk. I have no patience for your pathetic attempt at seduction.~
@462  = ~You wrong me! I wasn't trying to seduce you.~
@463  = ~Oh? Then what would you call those insipid words you just uttered?~
@464  = ~All right, I was, but I wasn't lying to you.~
@465  = ~Gavin, stop! I can't bear to watch! Do you have any idea how closely you are courting evisceration?~
@466  = ~This ought to be good. Why don't you tell her about her eyes, Gavin?~
@467  = ~*stay silent*~
@468  = ~Psst! Viconia! Why don't you see how much fawning he will do before you lance his ego like a boil.~
@469  = ~Gavin, leave Viconia alone. Viconia, sheath those claws. We'll have none of that nonsense here!~
@470  = ~I was paying her a compliment! Maybe if somebody was nice to her every once in a while, she wouldn't be so evil.~
@471  = ~That's it! I tried. You're on your own, Gavin!~
@472  = ~Gavin, please! Viconia is not the kind of lady who likes compliments from men who have had too much to drink.~
@473  = ~Don't blame me if you wake up with a black eye.~
@474  = ~You're right, Gavin. Why don't you tell her about the music in her voice.~
@475  = ~Hmmm. Good idea.~
@476  = ~Viconia, your eyes are like two ice crystals in a lake of midnight velvet....~
@477  = ~*oof* Gods, my g...~
@478  = ~You have abused my patience past all enduring! I will not stand here and be salivated over by a balding collection of faults and insecurities! If you continue to harass me, your n'abyl will not be the only parts of you that hurt!~
@479  = ~I am not balding... Hells, <CHARNAME>, did she have to knee me in the groin?~
@480  = ~You did ask for it.~
@481  = ~I would have done worse.~
@482  = ~You'll live.~
@483  = ~*sigh* Come on, Gavin. Just let it go.~
@484  = ~Sorry, Gavin. It's her loss.~
@485  = ~I don't give a gibberling's buttock for your honesty! I want your silence!~
@486  = ~I was just paying you a compliment. But I bet you are just not used to people being nice to you. You might even lose some of that evil if people just treated you decently every once in a while.~
@487  = ~I am warning you for the last time.~
@488  = ~Viconia, your eyes are flashing, like two ice crystals in a lake of midnight velvet....~
@489  = ~I don't give a gibberling's buttock for his fawning! I want his silence!~
@490  = ~Ah, very well, maybe I should just go find a place to sleep this off.~
@491  = ~You're right. Maybe I'd better just save it for when I'm sober.~
@492  = ~Nah, that won't work. She knows I'm tone deaf.~
@493  = ~I think I'd like to sleep this off, now.~
@494  = ~I doubt there is anything worse. Please, let me just sleep this off somewhere.~
@495  = ~I'm afraid you might be right.~
@496  = ~Gods, I feel... dreadful. I think I'd like to sleep this off, now.~
@497  = ~Doesn't feel like she's losing much, right now. Better sleep it off.~
@498  = ~<CHARNAME>, some of your words and actions are really quite offensive to me.~
@499  = ~Are you offending me on purpose, <CHARNAME>? You know I'm not fond of this kind of thing.~
@500  = ~<CHARNAME>, I am sorry that it has come to this, but I am too offended by what you have said and done to continue this friendship. I had hoped that you would become more sensitive or caring, but I just do not see that happening. I can no longer maintain our friendship. It is over.~
@501  = ~Since we're going to be travelling companions for a while, I would like to get to know you better.~
@502  = ~All right. Why don't you introduce yourself properly.~
@503  = ~I already know you as well as I want to know you, Gavin. Cut the smalltalk, and get back in line.~
@504  = ~Right. Just business, then.~
@505  = ~I've said that I'm a cleric of Lathander. I was born in Ulgoth's Beard, but I entered the service of the temple as a novice when I was twelve. Can it really be sixteen years ago? Anyway, I have been a Dawnbringer, or full priest, nine years, now.~
@506  = ~So why did you become a cleric?~
@507  = ~So how did that lead you to becoming an adventurer?~
@508  = ~You're rather old for a life on the road, aren't you?~
@509  = ~Thanks for the information.~
@510  = ~It is rather unlikely, isn't it? My parents were certainly never overly religious. But I always had a strong reverence for Lathander, though, and felt his presence in my life moreso than any of the other gods my family worshipped. My mother worshipped Lathander especially, though, so maybe that isn't so strange.~
@511  = ~Shortly before I joined the order, I found that with Lathander's power moving through me, I could do things other young people my age could not.~
@512  = ~But how about you?~
@513  = ~Well, you know my name is <CHARNAME>, and I was raised in Candlekeep by a sage named Gorion. It was a fairly typical childhood really.~
@514  = ~My business is my own.~
@515  = ~My name is <CHARNAME>, but I do not really feel like discussing my life in any further detail right now.~
@516  = ~That is one of the best childhoods a person could have. Did you like Candlekeep?~
@517  = ~Very much. It was a small community, so everyone knew everyone else, and it was very friendly. And I loved the library.~
@518  = ~I did. It was a good place to grow up.~
@519  = ~No, it was a bore. It was a small town with nothing to do. I'm glad to be out of there.~
@520  = ~That does sound appealing. The town where I grew up was small, too, but they did not have that library. I did not learn to read at all until I joined the temple, but I enjoy it now.~
@521  = ~But come, let us catch up. We'll have time to talk as we travel, I imagine.~
@522  = ~That is good to hear. But come, let us catch up. We'll have time to talk as we travel, I imagine.~
@523  = ~Well, we're certainly seeing the world, now.~
@524  = ~Suit yourself.~
@525  = ~Well, I'm sure we'll have plenty of opportunity to get to know each other as we travel.~
@526  = ~It is rather unlikely, isn't it? I certainly never set out to become one. But sometimes, a spiritual journey can lead to a physical one. It was time to put routine behind and go out into the world and do some good.~
@527  = ~You'll probably find plenty of routine in this lifestyle, too.~
@528  = ~Yeah, I could never be cooped up in some temple, praying all day.~
@529  = ~So what do you want to accomplish?~
@530  = ~Right. So let's get to it.~
@531  = ~Ah, but it's a different routine. But come, there will be plenty of opportunity to talk as we travel. Let's catch up.~
@532  = ~You'd be surprised how little time a cleric actually spends praying. There's work to do. Farming, travelling for the temple, people to help. It is a satisfying life, but it was time for a change.~
@533  = ~Well, there will be plenty of opportunity to talk as we travel. We should keep up.~
@534  = ~This is a troubled region. I almost have no idea where to start. But I believe that by helping you in your quest, I might serve my god and the greater good at the same time.~
@535  = ~But we're falling behind. There will be plenty of opportunity to talk later.~
@536  = ~As you wish.~
@537  = ~*smile* I prefer to think of it as 'seasoned,' but I should be able to keep up all right.~
@538  = ~I'm sure there will be time to talk later, if you're so inclined.~
@539  = ~We've talked a bit about our backgrounds, but I can't help wondering what led you to the life of an adventurer.~
@540  = ~I was not so much led to it as I was pushed into it. Not long ago, my foster father, Gorion, was murdered. I am searching for his killers.~
@541  = ~Candlekeep was just too small. I've always wanted to travel, and now I have the chance.~
@542  = ~Like you, I am motivated by a desire to do good in the world.~
@543  = ~Everything changes. It was time to move on.~
@544  = ~I don't know if this is really any of your business.~
@545  = ~I am sorry to hear that. Please accept my deepest condolences for your loss. Forgive me if I sound like I am prying, but I cannot help but wonder why anyone would wish such a man dead. Not that I have heard much about him at the temple, but what I have heard has been entirely favorable.~
@546  = ~You did not have to live with him! If you did, I am sure you would be able to think of plenty of reasons to kill him.~
@547  = ~I don't know why they killed him. It was not as if he needed many enemies. Just one.~
@548  = ~A powerful mage like Gorion is bound to have made a few enemies over the years.~
@549  = ~Thanks for the sympathy, but it really is too soon to talk about it.~
@550  = ~Thanks for the sympathy, but I am not even sure that Gorion was their target. They might have been after me.~
@551  = ~Whatever. Just get back to doing whatever it is clerics do.~
@552  = ~You're prying.~
@553  = ~Yet here you are, pursuing his murderers. You must have had some affection for him to abandon the safety of your home to chase after them.~
@554  = ~Not a bit. But if they were powerful enough to take out Gorion, they must be worth something.~
@555  = ~Yes, I do. It's just that this is has all happened so fast, I haven't really learned to accept his loss. So I say odd things, sometimes.~
@556  = ~My, this is awkward. I cannot say I endorse your search, under those conditions, but I hope that after the initial shock has worn off, you will consider more altruistic pursuits.~
@557  = ~Ah, I understand completely. And I apologize for my insensitivity. It must be very hard for you. I'll support you any way I can.~
@558  = ~That is true, but it does mean that it is going to be difficult to find him, especially without any leads. I'll help you, of course, but I was wondering how your search for your foster father's murderer related to your current activities. Did he have anything to do with bandit activities or the iron shortage?~
@559  = ~Certainly not that I'm aware of, but doing something is better than doing nothing. The chance is remote, but maybe it is somehow connected.~
@560  = ~Gorion did keep some influential company. It is always possible that someone of his association had an interest in current events and wanted to prevent his interference.~
@561  = ~Probably not, but it beats sitting at home in Candlekeep wishing I knew what was going on.~
@562  = ~I don't want to talk about this anymore.~
@563  = ~I suppose that's something. If nothing else, I admire your goals. A lot of people *would* sit at home and wait for the authorities to figure it out. Even if you don't find his killer, at least you will have made some good come of it.~
@564  = ~That is always possible, but if you are right, it could mean that we are up against a powerful enemy, indeed. You have my support, of course, but we'll have to be careful.~
@565  = ~As you wish. I apologize if I have been too nosy for your comfort.~
@566  = ~It's always possible, of course. But that opens the possibility that Gorion's unknown enemy or enemies could be involved with current events. If so, we might very well encounter them. We will have to be cautious.~
@567  = ~Whatever. Look, Gavin, if this trip is too dangerous for you, you can always go home.~
@568  = ~You are right, on both counts. I do not think we should stop what we're doing because it might be dangerous, but I think we should be careful.~
@569  = ~Maybe you are right about the powerful enemies, but I'm not going to give up if just because it might be dangerous.~
@570  = ~No, I'm not worried about my own neck... well, all right, I am, but I'm not about to let that stop me from helping you. Come on. Let's do what we can, and be careful.~
@571  = ~Then we stand a chance. Come on. Let's do what we can.~
@572  = ~No, I'm not saying that you should. I'm just saying that you should be careful. Hey, it isn't only my own neck I'm worried about here. There are a lot of good people who could be hurt if we go charging off and do something stupid. So let's move forwawrd, but carefully.~
@573  = ~Then I apologize. I had no intention of making you uncomfortable.~
@574  = ~That's horrible! What makes you say that?~
@575  = ~"Surrender your ward and nobody gets hurt" sounds pretty unambiguous to me.~
@576  = ~Just a hunch.~
@577  = ~Maybe I was mistaken.~
@578  = ~Yes, it is hard to take that any other way. I will help you, of course, but we will have to be exceptionally careful. Anyone powerful enough to take out a mage like Gorion is going to be a tough opponent.~
@579  = ~Ah. Well, in the absence of any conclusive proof, it is probably best to assume the worst, that it *was* you they were after. I'll help you, of course, but we'll need to be very careful.~
@580  = ~I hope so, but it would be wise to be careful, in any event.~
@581  = ~Sorry, I was just trying to help. Would you rather I kept quiet for the rest of the trip?~
@582  = ~No. I'm sorry. It's just too soon, and I'm having a hard time being polite to anyone, these days.~
@583  = ~Yes.~
@584  = ~No, it's all right. I understand that this is a very difficult time for you.~
@585  = ~I suppose this is a good an opportunity as any. But you seem to be driven by more than just dissatisfaction of the enforced quiet of small-town life. Is there another reason for this trip?~
@586  = ~No.~
@587  = ~My foster father, Gorion was murdered. I am looking for his killers.~
@588  = ~Well, if you are looking for excitement, you will probably find it in abundance.~
@589  = ~That is admirable, and I feel the same way. But, if I might be so inquisitive, why here and now?~
@590  = ~My foster father, Gorion was murdered. I want to do my part to improve the Sword Coast, but I am also looking for his killers.~
@591  = ~The area seems to be in need of some help, but I must confess that I always found Candlekeep to be too restrictive. It's a small town, without much to do. I am looking for adventure, as much as anything else.~
@592  = ~I feel that I should do something for the people of this area. The iron crisis and the bandits have left it very vulnerable. I want to help.~
@593  = ~I can hardly argue with that.~
@594  = ~I get the feeling that you do not want to talk about this.~
@595  = ~No, I do. You see, my foster father, Gorion was murdered. I want to do my part to improve the Sword Coast, but I am also looking for his killers.~
@596  = ~Well, I admit that the area seems to be in need of some help, but I always found Candlekeep to be too restrictive. It's a small town, without much to do. I am looking for adventure, as much as anything else.~
@597  = ~Not really.~
@598  = ~Sorry, I did not mean to offend. Would you rather I kept quiet for the rest of the trip?~
@599  = ~No. I'm sorry. I've just got a lot on my mind, and I'm having a hard time being polite to anyone, these days.~
@600  = ~No, it's all right. I have a tendency to babble, sometimes.~
@601  = ~<CHARNAME>, do you serve a god?~
@602  = ~Like you, I serve Lathander.~
@603  = ~I serve Helm.~
@604  = ~I do, but I do not serve Lathander.~
@605  = ~I worship Chauntea, goddess of things that grow.~
@606  = ~I worship Gond, god of smiths and artisans.~
@607  = ~I worship Helm, god of vigilance.~
@608  = ~I worship Ilmater, god of martyrdom and perseverance.~
@609  = ~I worship Kelemvor, god of the dead.~
@610  = ~I worship Lathander, too.~
@611  = ~I worship Lliira, goddess of joy.~
@612  = ~I worship Mielikki, goddess of the forests.~
@613  = ~I worship Mystra, goddess of magic.~
@614  = ~I worship Oghma, god of knowledge.~
@615  = ~I worship Selune, goddess of the moon.~
@616  = ~I worship Sharess, goddess of sensual pleasure.~
@617  = ~I worship Silvanus, god of nature.~
@618  = ~I worship Sune, goddess of love and beauty.~
@619  = ~I worship Tempus, god of battle.~
@620  = ~I worship Tymora, goddess of fortune.~
@621  = ~I worship Tyr, god of justice.~
@622  = ~I worship Umberlee, goddess of the sea.~
@623  = ~I worship Berronar Truesilver, goddess of family and obligations.~
@624  = ~I worship Clangeddin Silverbeard, god of battle and honor.~
@625  = ~I worship Dugmaren Brightmantle, god of invention.~
@626  = ~I worship Dumathoin, god of metal and burried wealth.~
@627  = ~I worship Gorm Gulthyn, protector of the dwarves.~
@628  = ~I worship Moradin, creation and smithing.~
@629  = ~I worship Sharindlar, god of healing.~
@630  = ~I worship Vergadain, god of luck.~
@631  = ~I revere all the Morndinsamman.~
@632  = ~I worship Corellon Larethian, god of elven magic and the arts.~
@633  = ~I worship Hanali Celanil, goddess of love.~
@634  = ~I worship Rillifane Rallathil, god of the woodlands.~
@635  = ~I revere all the Seladarine.~
@636  = ~I worship Baervan Wildwanderer, god of nature.~
@637  = ~I worship Baravar Cloakshadow, god of illusion.~
@638  = ~I worship Flandal Steelskin, god of mining and smithing.~
@639  = ~I worship Garl Glittergold, god of the Gnomes.~
@640  = ~I revere all the Lords of the Golden Hills.~
@641  = ~I worship Arvoreen, god of warriors.~
@642  = ~I worship Brandobaris, god of rogues.~
@643  = ~I worship Cyrrollalee, goddess of the home.~
@644  = ~I worship Sheela Peryroyl, goddess of nature, love and beauty.~
@645  = ~I worship Yondalla, goddess of the halflings.~
@646  = ~I revere all of Yondallas Children.~
@647  = ~I worship a different god.~
@648  = ~I revere all the gods.~
@649  = ~I am indifferent toward religion.~
@650  = ~I serve no god.~
@651  = ~It's good to have a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> in faith. My family gave nodding respect to all the gods, but my mother always had a special reverence for Lathander, as well.~
@652  = ~I was to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same for you?~
@653  = ~Yes, it was.~
@654  = ~Not really. I discovered my faith when I was nearly grown.~
@655  = ~Actually, faith isn't important to me at all. I mostly go my own way.~
@656  = ~That's good to know.~
@657  = ~Better later than never.~
@658  = ~I suppose there is room for that, too. Maybe you just haven't found the right religion, though. Don't worry. I'm no missionary.~
@659  = ~Helm's teachings and Lathander's are sometimes at odds, but I see no reason why that should be a problem in this group. There is certainly no reason the followers of any benevolent deities can not cooperate.~
@660  = ~I was drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same for you?~
@661  = ~Still you are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of faith. And it is good to be travelling in the company of a servant of a benevolent deity.~
@662  = ~I was drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith?~
@663  = ~*smiles* My sister Della worships Chauntea, well mostly Chauntea. She is an avid gardener, though, so it makes sense.~
@664  = ~I, myself, was drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith?~
@665  = ~*smiles faintly* A genius of a god, I must say, and creative in a very physical way. The faith is not at odds with the teachings of Lathander, who values creativity in any form, but I lack the mechanical aptitude to grasp the details.~
@666  = ~I, on the other hand, felt drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith?~
@667  = ~*smiles faintly* A stern god, but the fairness of his followers is enviable, especially when things are uneasy. I understand why the order of the religion is appealing, but I could never handle the routine. My father is a follwer of Tyr.~
@668  = ~*smiles sadly* I suppose all turn their prayers to Ilmater at times. One always has recourse with the god of perseverance and mercy, but there never seems to be an end to suffering in this life. Followers of Ilmater must be very special.~
@669  = ~While I certainly respect Ilmater, I was drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith?~
@670  = ~*smiles sadly* I suppose all must know about him, in the end, and he is fair, if not overly merciful. Forgive me, but I don't really understand his worship. As a healer, I understand the necessity, but there is very little joy there.~
@671  = ~I have been drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith?~
@672  = ~You must have had a very unusual childhood.~
@673  = ~I find that vaguely reassuring.~
@674  = ~*smiles* How delightful. The world certainly needs more of her followers. They must be very special people.~
@675  = ~*smiles* Then there is a kinship between our faiths. Clerics of Lathander are taught to revere things that grow, although I can not say we approach it with the same zeal as the follower of a forest deity would. I, myself, have never had any luck with plants, though it shames me to admit it.~
@676  = ~Even so, I was drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith?~
@677  = ~Ah. Well, that makes sense, given your profession.~
@678  = ~The god of knowledge and learning? A worthwhile religion, certainly. As a matter of fact, my sister Reed pays special devotion to him. But she's a scholar and a mage, so it's only natural. But my, she has a sense of humor. She inherited this ring I wear from a great uncle, who was also a mage. She knew I liked it, so she gave it to me as a present when I was ordained. Thing was, she placed an enchantment on it so now it won't come off! Not that I really want to take it off, anyway. I think of her little joke every time I look at it, and it always makes me smile.~
@679  = ~But back to religion. I was drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith?~
@680  = ~Selune and Lathander are allies, and our faiths are complimentary, on a basic level. You worship moonlight, I, sunlight, but they are both part of the natural cycle. And followers of Selune are no less devoted enemies of evil than Lathandrites.~
@681  = ~*Gavin looks inexplicably uncomfortable.* Ah. I see. Well...~
@682  = ~About Lathander, I mean my service to Lathander, I was drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith? No, don't answer that! Please forgive me. What a dreadful question!~
@683  = ~*smile* as a matter of fact, it was.~
@684  = ~Not surprisingly, I discovered my faith when I was nearly grown.~
@685  = ~Oh, my! If you'll excuse me, I think I need to check to make sure my pack is closed. I'll catch up.~
@686  = ~Ah, well, that's a relief. If you'll excuse me, I think I need to check to make sure my pack is closed. I'll catch up.~
@687  = ~I see. If you'll excuse me, I think I need to check to make sure my pack is closed. I'll catch up.~
@688  = ~Ah, yes. I can't say I've had much opportunity to watch his followers in action. Most of my time in that arena has been spent cleaning up the aftermath. Still, everything has a purpose.~
@689  = ~Ah, well that's convenient. You will put in a good word for us, I hope?~
@690  = ~You actually chose that... capricious goddess as your patron? I suppose people where I grew up gave her tribute, but I can't say she was worshipped as much as feared. That is her nature. The whole region did depend upon the sea, so it was only natural. Not the kindest of deities, but the sea is not always gentle.~
@691  = ~*smile* Well, religion is all about what is important, and it is hard to imagine anything more important than the home and family.~
@692  = ~*smile* I cannot say I am all that knowledgeable where Dumathoin is concerned, but that is probalby the point. He is also the god of secret knowledge, isn't he?~
@693  = ~*smile* The patron and protector of your people. You must enjoy the sense of community conveyed through your worship. Lathander advocates harmony between all the races, but maybe finding a shared purpose within the community is a good first step.~
@694  = ~*smile* A kindred spirit in a way. I've always found that aspect of my work to be the most rewarding.~
@695  = ~First among the Seldarine. You must enjoy the sense of community conveyed through your worship. Lathander advocates harmony between all the races, but maybe finding a shared purpose within the community is a good first step.~
@696  = ~Who will come to claim you in the afterlife, then? But everyone must walk their own road, I guess.~
@697  = ~I felt drawn to Lathander from an early age. Have you always felt the way you do, or was this more recent?~
@698  = ~I have always had a more general approach to religion.~
@699  = ~Not really. I underwent a recent crisis of faith.~
@700  = ~Well, there is always hope. Maybe you have not yet felt a kinship to any particular faith.~
@701  = ~Well, there is always hope. I hope you are able to reconcile your crisis soon.~
@702  = ~That is risky, with the afterlife that uncertain. Who knows who will claim you with no patron? But I would never tell anyone how to live.~
@703  = ~Worship of any benevolent god can really give you a sense of purpose, don't you think? I was drawn to Lathander from an early age. Was it the same with your faith?~
@704  = ~That's risky. Who will claim you in the afterlife? I, myself, felt drawn to Lathander from an early age. Maybe you just haven't found the right faith?~
@705  = ~No, I just don't like clerics.~
@706  = ~No, I just resent people telling me how to live my life.~
@707  = ~Maybe, but I have no desire to look.~
@708  = ~Maybe you can tell me about Lathander sometime. Maybe later, though.~
@709  = ~Sorry if I offended you.~
@710  = ~Not all religions do. Lathander, for example, asks very little of his followers. But I have taken much of your time. Maybe another day.~
@711  = ~You don't have to look. You will know it when you see it. But I have taken much of your time. I'll leave you be for a while.~
@712  = ~I would love to, but I think I have taken enough of your time for a while. Later, perhaps.~
@713  = ~Making a wild guess, I suppose you don't like talking about religion, either. Fair enough.~
@714  = ~May I ask your opinion on something, <CHARNAME>?~
@715  = ~Please do.~
@716  = ~Not now, Gavin.~
@717  = ~No, Gavin. Not now, not ever.~
@718  = ~As you wish. I shall walk elsewhere.~
@719  = ~Maybe later, then.~
@720  = ~One of the goals of Lathander's clergy is to promote interracial harmony. I think this is a noble and worthwhile goal, but sometimes, I wonder if cooperation between all peoples is possible. I wondered if you think this is possible, or even desirable.~
@721  = ~It might be possible, but I do not think it is desirable.~
@722  = ~I agree with you when you say that it is desirable, but I do not think it is possible.~
@723  = ~I believe that is neither.~
@724  = ~I think that it is both possible and desirable.~
@725  = ~Ugh. I do *not* want to talk about this.~
@726  = ~How about sentient spiders? Should we try to cooperate with them?~
@727  = ~You've got me there. I do not think I will ever be able to overcome my fear to that extent. Braver people might, though.~
@728  = ~Very well. I'll drop the subject. It is rather heavy for this time of the <DAYNIGHT>.~
@729  = ~That's a reassuring thought. If you wouldn't mind talking a little bit more about it, though, I'd also like to know why you feel as you do.~
@730  = ~I am not really in the mood to explain it.~
@731  = ~I can't see why everyone does *not* want it. Seriously, though, all it would take is a little encouragement, and a strong enough deterrent for people who stir up trouble.~
@732  = ~The benefits of such cooperation would be many. Peace, improved understanding, and improved trade are just some of the more obvious ones. I think mutual communication is a necessary first step. That leads to eventual understanding, which leads to tolerance, which leads to acceptance and harmony.~
@733  = ~I don't think there is an easy answer.~
@734  = ~If I think about it any longer, my head might explode.~
@735  = ~Fair enough. Thank you for your opinion.~
@736  = ~That sounds strangely ominous. What do you mean by encouragement, and what do you mean by deterrent?~
@737  = ~You'd think it would be obvious.~
@738  = ~By encouragement, I mean people should be made to do as they are told, and by deterrent, I mean that penalties for doing otherwise should be severe enough to prevent a recurrence, if you know what I mean.~
@739  = ~People are encouraged when they can see the positive results of their actions on a personal level. I know you can't control the thoughts of another, but you can influence their actions. A reward for behavior that fosters goodwill would help them realize the value of cooperation. A stiff fine, I think, would be enough of a deterrent for most people to avoid a second offense.~
@740  = ~I don't know, really. I like the idea, and think it could work, but I don't know if I'm qualified to think up an implementation strategy.~
@741  = ~I'm getting a headache, thinking about this.~
@742  = ~Not really, but I don't know if I want to hear the explanation after all. I apologize for starting a conversation and not finishing it, but I have a feeling we are not going to agree about the whys and wherefores, and I have no desire to stir friction in the group.~
@743  = ~It sounds more like domination of the weak by the strong to me. The very concept is against everything Lathander stands for. I am deeply troubled by your answer, and wish I had not asked.~
@744  = ~If that's what you want to call it, then yes, that would be preferable to pandering to everyone that wants to be 'special.'~
@745  = ~No, that came out wrong. I didn't mean it quite that way.~
@746  = ~I cannot believe you said that, and in my presence. That might compell compliance, but it is most definitely *not* a way to foster harmony.~
@747  = ~No matter how you meant it, it was still offensive.~
@748  = ~Appealing to a person's greed does not sound like the best of all possible worlds, but at least it isn't overly oppressive.~
@749  = ~Fair enough. That's always the stumbling block I hit. I want it, and I think it could work, but I have no idea how.~
@750  = ~Ha! I know the feeling. That's what happens when I think about it too long.~
@751  = ~A long, slow road, but one that might end well. That is probably the only long term solution, but it takes time, and progress is hard to measure. If you're a dreamer, then we both are.~
@752  = ~And *that* is precisely the problem.~
@753  = ~Ha! I know the feeling.~
@754  = ~I am inclined to disagree, but I would like to hear why you feel that way.~
@755  = ~You will never get people of different races to get along. They are just too different. After that, it makes no sense to even think about whether or not it is desirable.~
@756  = ~You would be asking people to give up their identity. No one is going to go along with that, nor should they.~
@757  = ~That is where we disagree. I do not think people are all that different. We all need the same things: food, shelter, warmth, love. Tastes may differ about what best satisfies those needs, but where there is common ground, there can be understanding.~
@758  = ~When one race's idea of food includes you, that limits the opportunity to further understanding.~
@759  = ~I don't think I want to talk about this, after all.~
@760  = ~I can see where that would be a problem. How depressing.~
@761  = ~I can see this conversation is going nowhere. Thanks for your time.~
@762  = ~Fair enough. Thank you for your time.~
@763  = ~I disagree. People do not have to give up their identities, they just have to learn that their identity does not give them the right to judge anyone who does not share it. But I can see that if we keep talking like this, I am going to wind up offending you, and I don't want that.~
@764  = ~So perhaps we will have to agree to disagree.~
@765  = ~I am afraid that you might be right, but it would be wrong for me to lose faith so easily. Why do *you* think it might not be possible?~
@766  = ~It is hard enough getting one person to abandon long-held prejudices. Just imagine that on a racial scale.~
@767  = ~People have this need to feel superior. Cooperation implies equality. That concept will never be universally popular.~
@768  = ~People like to fight. People on a racial scale like war. You are as unlikely to see racial cooperation as you are to see a world without war.~
@769  = ~That is my fear as well. *sigh* Well, there is no reason to give up on a dream even if the chance of success is slim. I'll keep hoping, but try not to be disappointed if I don't live to see it.~
@770  = ~Maybe not, but I can still hope.~
@771  = ~That is a very bleak picture. I sincerely hope you are wrong.~
@772  = ~Who would get to decide what is right? Peole would never stop squabbling.~
@773  = ~Because I shudder to think of what that would do to racial purity. First people start cooperating, then they start liking each other, and next thing you know, we've got a world full of mongrels. Let each race keep to themselves.~
@774  = ~There would be the risk of losing cultural identity.~
@775  = ~I would like to think that part of cooperation would mean working together to resolve things instead of forcing right/wrong decisions, but I might be a dreamer.~
@776  = ~Endangering racial purity? Mongrels? Surely you did not mean to phrase that so offensively.~
@777  = ~Yes, actually I did. I happen to like the idea of racial purity, and I don't really want to see a lot of half <PRO_RACE> children running around.~
@778  = ~No, I did not mean it the way it sounded. I just think people need to maintain their cultural identity.~
@779  = ~No, I did not mean it that way at all! I do not know what made me say that.~
@780  = ~That is really quite offensive. I think we should drop this subject immediately.~
@781  = ~I do not think that would necessarily follow. Elves will not stop being elves if they learn to cooperate with dwarves, for example. But I think we have talked about this long enough. This conversation is a little too inflamatory for my taste.~
@782  = ~That's all right. Things slip out sometimes. But that is part of the reason why everyone would benefit from such cooperation.~
@783  = ~<CHARNAME>, will you look at this! I could have sworn I packed these herbs correctly.~
@784  = ~They don't look too good, do they? I would have thought a cleric might be more adept with herbs.~
@785  = ~Is it supposed to be that... color?~
@786  = ~On the bright side, I think you now have a fine fungus collection.~
@787  = ~Can't you do anything right?~
@788  = ~So would I. I swear on Lathander's golden pinky toe, I am truly hopeless when it comes to plants. And herbs are supposed to thrive on neglect. I grew these herbs, harvested them, and thought I had dried them properly, now this!~
@789  = ~Maybe they're supposed to be brownish black when they dry. Were they fuzzy when you harvested them?~
@790  = ~Looks like you packed them wet. Or you got them wet at some point after they were dried. We have been out of doors a lot.~
@791  = ~I doubt I would have been able to do much better. Have you ever grown and dried herbs before?~
@792  = ~No. The ones I bought before I tried my hand at horticulture were kind of a light greenish-brown and rather crispy. Not these leathery black things. It is my secret shame. Lathander is supposed to favor those that foster plant growth, but I must have escaped his notice. I can do all the heavy garden work there is, right up to the point where the plants sprout. I have never had a way with plants. Brewing them, now, is a different story.~
@793  = ~It doesn't matter, I suppose. I can buy more once we're in town. But I would consider it a personal favor if you promised not to develop any scaly skin afflictions until then.~
@794  = ~Maybe, but I could have sworn they were dry enough. Apparently, I was mistaken. I do not think they could have gotten wet in my pack. I had it packed in oilcloth, and everything else is nice and dry.~
@795  = ~Lathander is supposed to favor those that foster plant growth, but I must have escaped his notice. I can do all the heavy garden work there is, right up to the point where the plants sprout. I have never had a way with plants. Brewing them, now, is a different story.~
@796  = ~No, I've usually either used the supply at the temple or purchased them in town.~
@797  = ~Good point. I wonder what it's good for, though. Maybe it would be safer just to throw it out.~
@798  = ~Ouch. I had no idea I was *that* inept.~
@799  = ~I'm sorry Gavin. I was making a joke, but I guess it was a bad one. I will admit that you will never make a good herbalist, but you are no more incompetent than the next person.~
@800  = ~You take yourself too seriously, Gavin. I was making a joke.~
@801  = ~Frankly, I'm surprised you haven't managed to kill yourself with your own hammer.~
@802  = ~No, I probably shouldn't take myself so seriously. But, clumsy as I am, I'm a bit self-conscious.~
@803  = ~*sheepish smile* I suppose you're right. But, clumsy as I am, I'm a bit self-conscious.~
@804  = ~You aren't winning any points, here. I do my best. If you want me to leave, just give the orders.~
@805  = ~<CHARNAME>, have you given any thought to what you will do when your quest is over?~
@806  = ~No, not really. It seems too far away to plan.~
@807  = ~I might try to resume a quiet life, whether at Candlekeep or somewhere else.~
@808  = ~Now that I've gotten a taste for adventuring, I don't see myself doing anything else.~
@809  = ~I don't see how this could be your business.~
@810  = ~Fair enough. But one day, this quest will end, and you will need to think about it eventually. You seem to have developed a flair for adventuring. Do you think you might like to go on?~
@811  = ~I might. Are you offering your services?~
@812  = ~I might, but if I do, I don't think I'll need a cleric, if you know what I mean.~
@813  = ~No, I think I'd like to settle down. I'm getting tired of the uncertainty.~
@814  = ~I really have no idea. I'll make that decision when the time comes.~
@815  = ~I might be tempted, but I have some family business to take care of first.~
@816  = ~I'm sorry your experience travelling with a cleric has been such a disappointment, then. But no hard feelings. I need to address some family business after this quest, anyway.~
@817  = ~I can certainly understand that. I'd like to settle down myself, but I don't think I'll have the opportunity for a while. I have some family business to conclude after this quest, and even after that is done, I think I will still have some travelling to do before I can settle anywhere for long.~
@818  = ~I can certainly understand that. Everything is so uncertain. I'd like to settle down myself, but I don't think I'll have the opportunity for a while. I have some family business to conclude after this quest, and even after that is done, I think I will still have some travelling to do before I can settle anywhere for long.~
@819  = ~You do seem to have a knack for it. I'll probably have to do a bit more travelling myself before I can settle down~
@820  = ~Are you offering your services?~
@821  = ~If I do, I don't think I'll need a cleric, if you know what I mean.~
@822  = ~It isn't really. Just making conversation.~
@823  = ~Well, you might say I have an interest. But you needn't tell me if it makes you uncomfortable.~
@824  = ~Sorry, Gavin. That was more rude than I intended.~
@825  = ~You really are nosy, aren't you?~
@826  = ~That's all right. It isn't as if you would have to decide any time soon.~
@827  = ~That's all right. You have a lot on your mind. Forget I asked, then.~
@828  = ~Ouch. I know you have a lot on your mind, but you don't have to be rude about it.~
@829  = ~So this is Baldur's Gate. It seems subtly different from the last time I was here. People seem more tense. It might just be local trouble, or it might be something more sinister. We should probably be careful.~
@830  = ~You think? We should be careful, but we can't hole up in a comfortable tavern and wait for everyone to get nice and happy again.~
@831  = ~You sound like a mother hen.~
@832  = ~Ho, hum. Seen one city, seen 'em all. Which way to the pub?~
@833  = ~Just think of everything there is to see here!~
@834  = ~No, but I would still try talking to some of the townsfolk, maybe find out why everyone seems edgy.~
@835  = ~And finding a nice, safe base of operations is might be a good idea. Taverns are good for that, because people come and go without a lot of awkward questions.~
@836  = ~Any recommendations?~
@837  = ~If I want your advice, I'll ask for it.~
@838  = ~Maybe later. I want to shop first.~
@839  = ~Let's just do what Scar said first, all right?~
@840  = ~Well, the patrons of the Blushing Mermaid are used to seeing a the unusual, so we would be unlikely to draw much attention, but we'd blend in just as well at the Blade and Stars, I think. The Elfsong is more respectable, but they do get a few exotic travellers, so we would probably not stand out too much. I don't think I've ever been in the Splurging Sturgeon or the Drakon Tavern, so I can't advise, there.~
@841  = ~Unusual is good. Which way to the Blushing Mermaid?~
@842  = ~I'm sure the Blade and Stars will do.~
@843  = ~I've had enough low-lifes for a while. How about the Elfsong?~
@844  = ~Where is the Splurging Sturgeon?~
@845  = ~Where is the Drakon Tavern?~
@846  = ~It doesn't matter, really. We'll just find a place and decide if it suits us then.~
@847  = ~The Blushing Mermaid and the Splurging Sturgeon are both in Northeast Baldur's Gate.~
@848  = ~The Blade and Stars is in Southeast Baldur's Gate.~
@849  = ~The Elfsong is in East Baldur's Gate. Sorcerous Sundries is there, too. You might find that place interesting.~
@850  = ~The Drakon Tavern is in Central Baldur's Gate.~
@851  = ~Good enough.~
@852  = ~No need to get snippy.~
@853  = ~Well there are certainly lots of good places to shop in Baldur's Gate.~
@854  = ~If you wish, but it might not be a bad idea to rest first.~
@855  = ~I'm sure the dangers here are no worse than they are elsewhere, but let's try not to make any enemies, all right?~
@856  = ~Oh, there's plenty to see and do here, all right, but maybe we should look for a base of operations first. Taverns are good for that. People come and go all the time, and no one asks too many questions.~
@857  = ~So, this is where our fate will be decided. Here, in this decrepit temple, we have the chance to finally put an end to this beast once and for all. <CHARNAME>, I have faith in your ability to see us through this, even as I have faith in the ability of light to overcome darkness.~
@858  = ~Lead on! Let the shadows flee before us!~
@859  = ~So, what next?~
@860  = ~The iron shortage. We've got to do something, you know.~
@861  = ~First things first. We'll resupply, investigate local concerns, and get a feel for the current situation.~
@862  = ~How should I know?~
@863  = ~Any suggestions?~
@864  = ~Ask Jaheira. She's always got something to say.~
@865  = ~Yes, we do. What did you have in mind?~
@866  = ~First, we gather information, then we decide on a plan. You should always have the facts first.~
@867  = ~Nothing, yet. I was hoping you'd have something clever to say.~
@868  = ~We need to rest before we do anything else.~
@869  = ~Gavin, give me some peace, please. I'll let you know if I come up with anything.~
@870  = ~That sounds like the best course. I'd like to help, but it does more good to know where it will be most needed.~
@871  = ~You are our leader. The decision will be yours. If you were to ask me, though, I would suggest talking to the people of Nashkel to find out where our help would be most needed.~
@872  = ~Never a bad idea. But what then?~
@873  = ~First, we gather information, then we decide on a plan. I'm too tired to think about it much more, but that would be best.~
@874  = ~That you are giving it some comsideration is enough for me. I would not wait too long to make up your mind, though. The area needs our help.~
@875  = ~Shh! She usually does, but that isn't the point. You are our leader. What do you think we should do?~
@876  = ~So, now what? Nashkel mine's been cleared, and the quality of the iron, and trade, should improve locally, but that isn't going to solve everything.~
@877  = ~You don't give a <PRO_MANWOMAN> a chance for much of a breather, do you?~
@878  = ~Do you expect me to solve all the world's problems?~
@879  = ~I suppose we start chasing bandits. It's like chasing shadows.~
@880  = ~You tell me.~
@881  = ~I don't know what you are going to do, but I am going to look for another cleric.~
@882  = ~Of course we need a break! But once we're rested, we're going to need to decide on a course.~
@883  = ~You can take as long as you like, but that isn't going to improve the lot of the folk around here. I'm not being critical. If you say we need a break, we need a break. But once we're rested, we're going to need to decide on a course.~
@884  = ~You know, I really think you could! Just not all of them today. I was thinking about our immediate concerns.~
@885  = ~Start chasing bandits, unless you have any better ideas.~
@886  = ~A good leader always listens to <PRO_HISHER> advisers. What would you recommend?~
@887  = ~I say we explore the area, get a better feel for where our help would be most useful.~
@888  = ~I'm taking the matter under consideration.~
@889  = ~No, that sounds like the best plan to me.~
@890  = ~I would suggest restocking our supplies and investigating the bandits. They have to come from somewhere.~
@891  = ~Sounds good to me.~
@892  = ~Good enough. If you're open to suggestion, though, I would recommend restocking our supplies and investigating the bandits. They have to come from somewhere.~
@893  = ~Uh, no, not exactly. I was thinking about our immediate concerns.~
@894  = ~It is, but I think it is probably our best course. They have to come from somewhere.~
@895  = ~I wouldn't *tell* you to do anything, my friend, but I might make a recommendation. These bandits have to come from somewhere. I'd start trying to find out where.~
@896  = ~I wouldn't *tell* you to do anything, but I might make a recommendation. These bandits have to come from somewhere. I'd start trying to find out where.~
@897  = ~I am sorry you have not found my services worth retaining, but you are certainly free to make your own decisions. If you would prefer that I leave, I would be happy to do so.~
@898  = ~No, Gavin, just ease up on me a bit.~
@899  = ~That might be for the best. It's time we parted company.~
@900  = ~Very well, I will go along with you for now. But I could be better pleased with our actions. I won't stand for much more of the same, if you know what I mean.~
@901  = ~Very well. I hope you can be made to see the error of your ways before it is too late.~
@902  = ~Every day, we are faced with poverty and violence. It never ends. We've seen raided caravans, the widows of Nashkel, bandits on the roads and worse, orphans everywhere... Even in Beregost, life is unkind for some. I doubt the courtesans outside Feldposts' would have chosen that profession had there been any other choice. Sometimes, I feel powerless to alleviate the misery around me.~
@903  = ~I know what you mean, but we're doing all that we can to help.~
@904  = ~I don't think there's much we can do about it.~
@905  = ~So what do you recommend?~
@906  = ~Actually, I don't think the courtesans mind all that much.~
@907  = ~You can alleviate the misery around me by not talking about it so much.~
@908  = ~I suppose you are right. We are doing what we can. Doesn't it bother you, though?~
@909  = ~Of course, Gavin. I'm not blind. I just keep hoping that once this part of the world is a little safer, trade will improve, and everyone will be able to live a little better.~
@910  = ~Not really. I know we're doing all we can, and I must be content with that. There are a lot of evils you can't fix by praying and smiting any evil you can find, Gavin.~
@911  = ~And that, my friend, is why you are leading this group. You have the vision to see past the skirmishes and filth and hold on to the thought of a better future.~
@912  = ~I know that. And I know we're doing the best we can. The knowledge doesn't keep me from wishing I could see past the skirmishes and filth to a better future, though.~
@913  = ~I think we could. I believe there has to be more we can do to help the people we meet every day, even if it's only in a small way. Doesn't the poverty and oppression bother you, though?~
@914  = ~And that, my friend, is why you are leading this group. Even if we haven't done as much as we could have yet, you have the vision to see past the skirmishes and filth and hold on to the thought of a better future.~
@915  = ~Forgive me for disagreeing with you, but I must. There *is* more we can do. The knowledge doesn't keep me from wishing I could see past the skirmishes and filth to a better future, though.~
@916  = ~There is always something more we can do, but I must admit we are doing well. Doesn't the affliction of the people bother you, though?~
@917  = ~I think there has to be more we can do to help the people we meet every day, even if it's only in a small way. Doesn't the poverty and oppression bother you, though?~
@918  = ~I believe there has to be more we can do to help the people we meet every day, even if it's only in a small way. Fighting bandits and... monsters... is a start, but hardly the ultimate solution. Doesn't the poverty and oppression bother you?~
@919  = ~How can you even think that? If you were a woman, would you choose to let every filthy mongrel with enough coin to buy your time violate you like that? It's degrading, and worse. Set a price on your body, and pretty soon, you'd start to think even your life isn't worth much more.~
@920  = ~It's a symptom of the evil that infects this world, but not the disease. I believe there has to be more we can do to help the people we meet every day, even if it's only in a small way. Fighting bandits and... monsters... is a start, but hardly the ultimate solution. Doesn't the poverty and oppression bother you?~
@921  = ~How can you even think that? Would you choose to let every filthy mongrel with enough coin to buy your time violate you like that? It's degrading, and worse. Set a price on your body, and pretty soon, you'd start to think even your life isn't worth much more.~
@922  = ~I suppose I do preach a bit more than I should. Still, I believe there has to be more we can do to help the people we meet every day, even if it's only in a small way. Fighting bandits and... monsters... is a start, but hardly the ultimate solution. Doesn't the poverty and oppression bother you?~
@923  = ~Fine! I'll save you from the sermon, since you're in such a foul mood.~
@924  = ~I know we still have a long way to go, but I can't help feeling happier that the bastard is dead.~
@925  = ~It isn't like you to be so vengeful, Gavin.~
@926  = ~What a horrible thing to say!~
@927  = ~I know what you mean. Personally, I would have liked to see him suffer more.~
@928  = ~I'm just glad it's over.~
@929  = ~I'm getting pretty tired of the suffering and ruined lives these vermin leave in their wake. It has to end, and if my hands get a little dirty in the process, so be it.~
@930  = ~You're changing, Gavin. The cleric we met outside the Song of the Morning would not have said that.~
@931  = ~I could not agree more.~
@932  = ~Just don't become a monster to destroy one.~
@933  = ~Whatever gets the job done.~
@934  = ~That might have been satisfying, but it would not have served any additional purpose. His death was enough. I'm getting pretty tired of the suffering and ruined lives these vermin leave in their wake. It has to end, and if my hands get a little dirty in the process, so be it.~
@935  = ~It isn't over. We've made a start, but it is far from over. I'm getting pretty tired of the suffering and ruined lives these vermin leave in their wake. It has to end, and if my hands get a little dirty in the process, so be it.~
@936  = ~Maybe not, but I've seen some things that man never expected to see. Somebody has to stand up for that which is right and decent in this world, or it will surely perish. I'm glad we stand together.~
@937  = ~Somebody has to stand up for that which is right and decent in this world, or it will surely perish. I'm glad we stand together.~
@938  = ~Wise words, <CHARNAME>. But, no, I'm stronger than that. Somebody has to stand up for that which is right and decent in this world, or it will surely perish. I'm glad we stand together.~
@939  = ~As long as the good is served. Somebody has to stand up for that which is right and decent in this world, or it will surely perish. I'm glad we stand together.~
@940  = ~I'm sorry for picking such a bad time to bring this up, but we're getting to the point where I might have to make some... arrangements.~
@941  = ~Do you mean about your daughter?~
@942  = ~What are you talking about?~
@943  = ~We've made an enemy of the entire Iron Throne, and you're telling me that you've got to make arrangements *now*?~
@944  = ~You had better not be running from the law.~
@945  = ~Yes, I mean my daughter. She means everything to me. What we are doing is dangerous. I know that. If I die, and you survive, would you do something for me?~
@946  = ~What would you like me to do?~
@947  = ~I'm not making any promises. If you want to make any arrangements, you're going to have to live to see them through.~
@948  = ~You're on your own, Gavin. I'm not doing anything for you.~
@949  = ~I'm talking about Lanie, my daughter.~
@950  = ~Lanie means everything to me. What we are doing is dangerous. I know that. If I die, and you survive, would you do something for me?~
@951  = ~We're running out of time, and our danger is very real. I've got to make some plans... just in case.~
@952  = ~This might come as a surprise to you, but I have a daughter. She is five years old, and her name is Lanie. It's a long story, and I don't really want to go into any details, but Lanie's mother and I are estranged, and have been since her birth.~
@953  = ~I'm not running from anything, anymore. But we're running out of time, so I have to make some arrangements... just in case.~
@954  = ~*grips your shoulder* Thank you, my friend.~
@955  = ~I want you to take a message to both Lanie and to Miranda, her mother.~
@956  = ~I want you to tell Lanie that I love her, and that I'm very proud of her. Tell her that I did not want to leave her, but I was doing something I believed in. If you can get it off my hand, give her my ring. But the most important thing is that she knows that I love her very, very much.~
@957  = ~I'd like you to remind Miranda of our agreement that my brother Gordon would stand as Lanie's godfather, if anything happened to me. She agreed to this years ago, but I'm not sure she remembers. Gordon is older than me, but his youngest is even younger than Lanie. He is a fine man, and a good father. If Miranda needs any help, as far as Lanie is concerned, she can count on Gordon and his wife, Emma, whenever she needs it.~
@958  = ~There is also the matter of Lanie's education. She is supposed to be enrolled at the temple of Oghma in Baldur's Gate. Her education is going to cost over a thousand gold pieces. That's why I took up adventuring in the first place.~
@959  = ~Miranda and Lanie live in Beregost, not far from the Tavenhurst Manor, in a house that shares a back garden with Roe and Mirianne's house. It's on the same street as the Red Sheaf Inn, but on the opposite side, and all the way at the end.~
@960  = ~Would you pass along those two messages, and see that Miranda gets my share of the treasure, for Lanie's education?~
@961  = ~Of course.~
@962  = ~I'll try.~
@963  = ~I think if you're going to die, I'm not going to be far behind you.~
@964  = ~We'll see how this ends. You aren't dead yet.~
@965  = ~I'd like you to remind Miranda of our agreement that my brother Gordon would stand as Lanie's godfather, if anything happened to me. She agreed to this years ago, but I'm not sure she remembers. Gordon is older than me, but his youngest is even younger than Lanie. He is a fine man, and a good father. If Miranda needs any help, as far as Lanie is concerned, she can count on Gordon and his wife, Emma, whenever she needs it.~
@966  = ~Well hear me out, anyway. I want you to take a message to both Lanie and to Miranda, her mother.~
@967  = ~I thought you my friend. Oh, well. Let's hope I don't die.~
@968  = ~Thank you, my friend.~
@969  = ~I could ask no more.~
@970  = ~*smile* I think you are destined for more than a shallow grave.~
@971  = ~*chuckles* No, I'm not, and I hope to keep it that way. Well, my friend, I won't pressure you for a commitment, but I hope that you will honor a father's last wish for his child.~
@972  = ~Be careful, my friend. These catacombs are unwholesome. Believe nothing you see.~
@973  = ~Aren't you a right little ray of sunshine?~
@974  = ~Oh, I'm wary all right.~
@975  = ~What is there to be afraid of among the silent dead?~
@976  = ~When I was young, not long after I went to the Song of the Morning Temple, I went exploring. I found a key that let me into the catacombs beneath the temple. I unlocked the grille, went through, and it closed and locked behind me. I was startled by a spider, and I dropped the key. I fumbled to catch it on the way down, and managed to kick it back through the grille into the vestibule. Most of the first day I was locked in there, I explored the crypts. It was two days before old Bram found me there. As punishment for my disobedience, I was assigned to help Bram with the next lot of housekeeping: cleaning out all the rat droppings and dead flowers, that sort of thing. We came across a clutch of undead one door further along than I had gone in my solitary exploration.~
@977  = ~All I ask is that you be careful. Not everything is as it seems.~
@978  = ~With good reason. When I was young, not long after I went to the Song of the Morning Temple, I went exploring. I found a key that let me into the catacombs beneath the temple.

@979  = ~Good. When I was young, not long after I went to the Song of the Morning Temple, I went exploring. I found a key that let me into the catacombs beneath the temple.

@980  = ~Enough. When I was young, not long after I went to the Song of the Morning Temple, I went exploring. I found a key that let me into the catacombs beneath the temple.

@981  = ~When this is over, I will need to leave your company for a time. Once the present crisis is resolved, Baldur's Gate will be more peaceful. I must go back to Beregost and get Lanie. I will bring her back here, to Baldur's Gate, so I can get her enrolled in school. She will not be at liberty to return home for several months, so I will be able to bear you company a while, after that. If you're still in Baldur's Gate, I'll rejoin you.~
@982  = ~Anyway, on we go.~
@983  = ~You first!~
@984  = ~Indeed, yet <PRO_HESHE> has chosen the way of pain.~
@985  = ~Indeed! Though I would be most grateful if you would speak of this to no one.~
@986  = ~What was that? Oh, never mind. I probably do not want to know.~
@987  = ~If you can retrieve the emeralds, I am content.~
@988  = ~You have earned your reward, bringing a murderer to justice.~
@989  = ~As mayor, I thank you.~
@990  = ~Very true.~
@991  = ~Madness, indeed, to take from one who has nothing!~
@992  = ~Thank you.~
@993  = ~See you soon! Bye!~
@994  = ~Oh hush. Of course <PRO_HESHE> knows what <PRO_HESHE>'s doing.~
@995  = ~<CHARNAME> makes the decisions around here, Gavin.~
@996  = ~*sigh* Never mind.~
@997  = ~Farewell.~
@998  = ~*sigh* Just end it.~
@999  = ~Thank you.~
@1000  = ~Wisdom or folly, it matters not. Alas, that my masterpiece should go unfinished!~
@1001  = ~Alas, Ellesime!~
@1002  = ~I must go elsewhere for help.~
@1003  = ~Thank you, though there is nothing you could have done to prevent this.~
@1004  = ~Adorable! Bye, now!~
@1005  = ~Watch, now!~
@1006  = ~Even so!~
@1007  = ~No, no. We'll all be family, you'll see.~
@1008  = ~Yes! Now hold still!~
@1009  = ~Yes, now hurry!~
@1010  = ~I think it shall not be so easy!~
@1011  = ~Still, I have my life. Farewell.~
@1012  = ~Hush... Now, Oompah...~
@1013  = ~That's enough, <CHARNAME>! You've had your fun, now leave these young people to their follies.~
@1014  = ~Miss, please, calm down! No one is going to hurt you! We're going to leave now, and you two can get on with whatever we interrupted. Isn't that right, <CHARNAME>?~
@1015  = ~Er... yes, of course. We'll leave you alone now.~
@1016  = ~I don't know about that, Gavin. She looks like she's got some spirit, if you know what I mean.~
@1017  = ~We're very sorry for upsetting you, miss. It was just <CHARNAME>'s idea of a joke.~
@1018  = ~Please excuse us, and we'll be on our way.~
@1019  = ~I am not going to help you slaughter an innocent boy!~
@1020  = ~If that's what you want to do, you have to go through me first!~
@1021  = ~Aiiiiiyia! Gods, <CHARNAME>, I can face anything on Faerun, but not spiders. Too damn many legs...~
@1022  = ~Gods, <CHARNAME>, you're a bastard, and no mistake! Couldn't you have just left these young people to their follies? I'll back you because I have to, but you're no friend of mine.~
@1023  = ~Eek!~
